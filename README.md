# BriskPKG
A package format for the **Brisk** game engine.

## Known Issues
### VS2019 Compiler
The SDK Tool will not build under the Visual Studio 2019 compiler.
I do not know why, I can only say to not use it.

I test this under the CLang compiler on Windows, which you can now natively install for VS2019.
